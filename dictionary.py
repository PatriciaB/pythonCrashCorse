"""
Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary describing a music album . 
The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these 
two pieces of information . Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums . 
Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the album information correctly . 
Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album . 
If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary . 
Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album
