"""
9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 166) . 
Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0 . 
Create an instance called restaurant from this class . Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, 
and then change this value and print it again . Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number
of customers that have been served . Call this method with a new number and print the value again . 
Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served . 
Call this method with any number you like that could 
represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of business

9-1. Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant . 
The __init__() method for Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type . 
Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of information, and a method called 
open_restaurant() that prints a message indi- cating that the restaurant is open . Make an instance called 
restaurant from your class . Print the two attributes individually, and then call both methods
